# 🧠 Overqualification Detector 9000 Ultra

*A high-powered, completely unnecessary diagnostic tool to determine if you're overqualified — spoiler: you're not.*

## 🪄 What is this?

The **Overqualification Detector 9000 Ultra** is a satirical C# console app designed to humorously simulate a corporate-grade, AI-powered qualification analysis. You input absolutely anything... and it still tells you you're not overqualified. Because that's how it works.

> ⚠️ This is fake. But proudly fake. Built for laughs, not logic.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1
You type random thoughts or real credentials.

### Step 2
The program pretends to:
- Boot a diagnostic engine
- Link with the "HR AI"
- Authenticate your life choices
- Consult the "HR Oracle"
- Calibrate humility sensors™

### Step 3
It concludes:
> **"You are not overqualified; you simply haven’t unlocked your full potential yet!"**
