# 🧠 Not Overqualified™

*A totally unnecessary, 100% fake software solution to a problem no one has.*

## 🎯 What is this?

**Not Overqualified™** is a parody program that takes in your professional information — skills, certifications, experience, whatever — and always returns one cold, hard truth:

> ❌ You are NOT overqualified.

It's a satire of resume screening, job application tools, and maybe life in general. Built entirely for fun, with no real purpose except to exist.

## 🛠 How It Works

You enter any combination of:
- 💼 Work experience
- 📜 Certifications
- 💡 Skills
- 🎓 Degrees
- 🧪 Superpowers

Then the app confidently informs you: *You are not overqualified.* (No matter what you entered. Seriously.)

## 🤷‍♂️ Why?

Because sometimes code should just make you laugh.
